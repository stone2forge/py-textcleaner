# py-textcleaner

Clean any extra whitespaces from your copied text (PDF or e-books files) through the terminal with a simple python script.

## Instalation

Just download the python file and store it somewhere.

## Usage

Execute the python script, paste your text, and hit enter.

## Known Issues

- If you tell me there's something wrong with this script, I'll curl up and cry.
- Your text must be continous and able to be pasted into one single line, if your text wants to break into two or more separate lines it will break your text. I will look forward into this.
